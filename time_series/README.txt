run with 'python extra_credit.py'  then it will output every products' week 51 prediction and the window I chose and the mean squared error.

the path of Sales_transactions_Dataset_Weekly.csv is already writen into the program so no need to call it again

I use ridge regression, and window 26, which I can get the error around 17.2.

I've tried with linear regression but the result is not good enough.

I also run with the window from 2 to 50, which 26 gives the best result, others are all around 25 to 35.
